## About Data Cloud

The Data Cloud platform provides students with essential skills to thrive in a data-driven world. The curriculum focuses on algorithmic thinking, computational paradigms, and an introduction to machine learning. Students will learn to apply algorithms and foundational machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems using data and computation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will:

- Analyze algorithm complexity in terms of computation time using Python.
- Identify and solve recursive problems using Python.
- Understand and design software using UML diagrams.
- Apply and implement data structures using object-oriented programming.
- Develop algorithms for linear regression and logistic regression.
- Evaluate machine learning models using error metrics and confusion matrices.
- Design and implement state machines with object-oriented paradigms.
- Debug code effectively using print statements and other techniques.

## Instructional Methods and Expectations

This course adopts a project-based and flipped-classroom strategy. Students are expected to complete pre-class activities and actively participate in class discussions and projects. Weekly mini-projects build toward a capstone project at the end.

Class sessions involve hands-on programming and group problem-solving, supported by pre-readings and homework.
